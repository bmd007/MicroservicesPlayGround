Yet, there is no support for oauth2 in reactive web ; so the auth project will remain uncompleted until spring provides support for oauth in web-flux

then for now we use a servlet(webMVC) based security microservices as authorization server

--------------
use : server.address: 127.0.0.1 for making microservices only accessible for gateWay???
